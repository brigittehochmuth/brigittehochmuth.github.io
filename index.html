              Abstract: This paper establishes a link between labor market reforms and an increase in the reforming country’s net foreign asset position via a precautionary savings channel. Specifically, we evaluate the current account effects of a major German labor market reform that reduced the generosity of unemployment benefits. Using a heterogeneous agent model of a small open economy with labor market frictions, we show that accounting for precautionary savings is qualitatively and quantitatively important for current account dynamics. In the first five years following its implementation, the reform contributed 12 percent to the dynamics of the German current account. Furthermore, welfare gains and losses are distributed unequally among agents. Compared to a closed economy, the reform is more detrimental.

              Abstract: This paper studies how individual risk attitudes shape occupational choice and wealth accumulation. Using self-reported individual risk preferences from the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP), we estimate that an increase in risk tolerance raises the probability of a worker transitioning to self-employment. We also develop a life-cycle model of occupational choice with Epstein-Zin preferences and heterogeneous risk attitudes to study how risk aversion interacts with entrepreneurial ability and wealth in determining entry into self-employment and its aggregate implications. Counterfactual simulations show that increasing business risk reduces entry but improves selection by entrepreneurial skills. In contrast, Germany’s “1-Euro GmbH” reform of 2008 weakened the role of risk tolerance for entry and increased participation by more risk-averse individuals.

            <strong>Financial Constraints, Firm Age, and the Labor Market</strong><br>

              Abstract: I document the heterogeneous effects of credit supply shocks on the labor market over time and by firm age. During the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), a credit crunch caused young firms to reduce employment significantly more than old firms. The housing bust starting in 2006 eroded young firms' collateral, restricting their borrowing capacity. To disentangle the relative contributions of the credit supply and net worth channels, I develop a financial friction model with an explicit firm age structure. The model explains the empirical findings by showing how a simultaneous credit crunch and decline in young firms' net worth disproportionately affect their borrowing capacity and labor demand. While old firms shift toward equity financing in response to the shock, young firms rely heavily on debt financing and are forced to reduce labor demand. Given that young firms disproportionately drive aggregate job growth, these findings explain the sluggish labor market recovery after the GFC and highlight the critical role of firm age in amplifying macroeconomic shocks.

            <strong>Incomplete Insurance and Open-Economy Spillovers of Labor Market Reforms</strong><br>

              Abstract: This paper shows that less generous unemployment benefits in one country may generate substantial negative long-run consumption spillovers to non-reforming countries under incomplete consumption insurance. While lower benefits reduce unemployment in the reforming country, employed workers increase their precautionary savings to compensate for reduced government-provided insurance. A portion of these additional savings flows to the non-reforming country and depresses long-term consumption due to the negative net foreign asset position. To discipline our quantitative model, we estimate the increase of Germany’s tradable sector in the aftermath of the Hartz unemployment insurance reform based on firm-level data. Our quantitative model matches a significant fraction of various macroeconomic trends after the reform, namely Germany’s persistent increase of aggregate savings and net foreign assets, the increase of net exports, the real exchange rate depreciation within the Eurozone, and the decline in unemployment. Conversely, Germany’s wage moderation before the reform appears to be unrelated to most of these phenomena.

            <strong>Fiscal Policy under Labor Shortages</strong> <span class="meta">(with Gregor Böhl)</span>
            <p class="meta">
              Abstract: We document that the households' labor market participation margin is a key driver of macroeconomic dynamics and policy responses. We build a HANK model with participation choice in which shifts in demographics, productivity, or preferences can lead to significant labor shortages, which strongly alter inflation and output responses to economic shocks and policy measures. While either the rich or the poor reject common policies such as increases in government spending or tax cuts because of their distortionary effect on labor market participation, we find that untargeted transfers are Pareto improving.

              Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the ‘Hartz IV’ reform, which reduced the generosity of long-term unemployment benefits. We propose a model with different unemployment durations, where the reform initiates both a partial effect and an equilibrium effect. We estimate the relative importance of these two effects and the size of the partial effect based on the IAB Job Vacancy Survey. Our approach does not hinge on an external source for the decline in the replacement rate for long-term unemployed. We find that Hartz IV was a major driver for the decline of Germany’s steady state unemployment and that partial and equilibrium effect were nearly of equal importance. In addition, we provide direct empirical evidence on labor selection, one potential dimension of recruiting intensity.

              Abstract: Short-time work is a labor market policy that subsidizes working time reductions among firms in financial difficulty to prevent layoffs. Many OECD countries have used this policy in the Great Recession. This paper shows that the effects of short-time work are strongly time dependent and nonlinear over the business cycle. It may save up to 0.87 jobs per short-time worker in deep economic crises. In expansions, the effects are smaller and may turn negative. We disentangle discretionary short-time work from automatic stabilization in German data using smooth transition VARs.
